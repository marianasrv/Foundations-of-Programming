# Foundations of Programming Projects 👩🏽‍💻

This project was developed under the Foundations of Programming course of the Bachelors Degree in Computer Science and Engineering at Instituto Superior Técnico, Lisbon.

The objective of this projet was to develop a encryption algorithm, using Python. The project is divided into two parts: in the first part, the algorithm is based on the Polybius square, and in the second part, it is based on the Playfair cipher.
